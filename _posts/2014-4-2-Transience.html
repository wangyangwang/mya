<p class="lead">"Transience is a generative composition using statistics of births and deaths in NYC to tell a musical narrative of the city. A multi-channel system of speakers plays musical sounds as a child is born or as a death occurs, representing each borough's data. Variables such as gender, birth, death, and location trigger notes to create a soundscape." - Osukaru Kuringspoh</p>
<p>I am fansnated by Oscar's project and collaborated with him to create the visulaization. Using particle system, I recreated a vitural map of New York City. Each event happening here correspond to each death and birth in the city.</p>
