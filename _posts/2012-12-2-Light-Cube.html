<p>A pair of light cubes that 24h/7d connect to each other, using the brightness as a symbol.Each light receives measurement of the other lightâ€™s ambiance brightness via internet connection and replicates it inside its own cubic shade. This project is an attempt to create an honest exchange between two extended human existence. Once in a while, we get into situations where the matter at hand evolves beyond our own comprehension. Lacking words to describe thoughts and feelings, light becomes a non-filtered confession, comfort of trust, and symbol of unconditional support.
