        <h3>Just Another Facebook Friend</h3>
        <p>It’s a Chrome extension with an ON and OFF icon, so you can choose whether to let him talk. When you click on your own Status Updates or other people’s posts, he bluntly spits out insensitive facts like “Nobody is really special” and “Everyone eventually dies” to remind you to constantly check in with what’s real before getting sucked into the dreamland of “I wish life could be like this.”</p>

        <h3>Just Another Internet</h3>
        <p>Ever wondered what Google and Facebook look like in China? "Just Another Internt" Chrome Extension is for you. When you install it on your computer, Chrome prevents you from accessing all websites that's normally blocked inside The Great Wall, just as how you would experience it if you were in China.</p>
