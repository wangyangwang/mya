<p class="lead">The KIND lamp is a system designed to collect, and measure the social relationship of New York residents. In a nutshell, it is a giant lamp fueled by people’s kindness towards each other.</p>

<h5>Step One:</h5> <p>A physical button is placed in a public space to collect response to a simple question, “Were you treated nicely today?” We hope the design of the physical button, comparing to collecting answers through online questionnaires, would capture people’s emotional feelings about a complex social issue, in a more direct and instinctive way.</p>

<h5>Step Two:</h5>
<p>Upon pushing the button, the physical response is translated into digital signal, sent wirelessly to an online database. The database aggregates data, and calculates the average response throughout the day, on a real-time basis.</p>

<h5>Step Three:</h5>
<p>A large lamp, placed in a separate public space nearby, receives the average data calculation through a wifi shield. The light sensor on the lamp luminates the lamp based on the calculation, in order to reflect the percentage of people feeling “treated nicely” by their fellow citizens” at that moment. The higher the percentage, the brighter the light. Data collection (the button), data processing (computer and database), and data display (the lamp) are located separately from each other and connected through wireless devices only. We hope that this design will control user-bias influenced by the result of the analysis.</p>
